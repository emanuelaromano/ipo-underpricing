# IPO Underpricing Analysis

## Overview

Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) mark a company's shift from private to public ownership. A common issue in IPOs is mispricingâ€”when the first-day closing price differs from the offer price. Underpricing, where the stock closes above its IPO price, benefits investors but may lead to lost capital for the issuing firm.

## Project Objectives

Our project focuses on analyzing and predicting the first-day trading performance of IPOs, with two central objectives:

1. Predict whether a newly-issued stock will be underpriced
2. Quantify the extent of mispricing, measured as the difference between the stock's first-day closing price and its IPO listing price

Understanding IPO mispricing has broad practical relevance:
- For investors: The ability to forecast underpricing presents a potential strategy to capture early gains and better manage risks during the volatile post-IPO period
- For underwriters and issuing companies: Accurate pricing is crucial - setting the offering price too low can lead to significant opportunity costs, while pricing it too high can reduce investor demand and result in a failed IPO

## Data Sources

The project utilizes multiple data sources to ensure comprehensive analysis:
- Historical IPO data from Bloomberg
- Macroeconomic indicators from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
