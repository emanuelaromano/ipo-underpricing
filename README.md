# IPO Underpricing Analysis

## Overview

Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) represent a critical event in a company's lifecycle, marking the transition from private to public ownership. The pricing of these newly-issued stocks has significant implications not only for the issuing firms but also for investors, underwriters, and the broader market. A key phenomenon observed in IPOs is mispricing, which occurs when the stock's trading price on the first day diverges from its offering price. In particular, a stock is considered underpriced if its closing price on the first day of trading exceeds its IPO listing price - while often favorable for investors, this condition may result in substantial capital left on the table for the issuing company.

## Project Objectives

Our project focuses on analyzing and predicting the first-day trading performance of IPOs, with two central objectives:

1. Predict whether a newly-issued stock will be underpriced
2. Quantify the extent of mispricing, measured as the difference between the stock's first-day closing price and its IPO listing price

Understanding IPO mispricing has broad practical relevance:
- For investors: The ability to forecast underpricing presents a potential strategy to capture early gains and better manage risks during the volatile post-IPO period
- For underwriters and issuing companies: Accurate pricing is crucial - setting the offering price too low can lead to significant opportunity costs, while pricing it too high can reduce investor demand and result in a failed IPO
